# Data-Wrangling-and-Visualization
In this coding challenge we are investigating cancer gene expression dataset that looks at gene expression on both tumor and non-tumor tissues that are related to expression of genes that cause either breast cancer or liver cancer. The question posed is do these genes we're looking at have a specific significance on expression. Specifically, I'm looking at the RAD51C, an important expression gene in breast cancer, and TP53, a well-known gene involved with liver cancer manifestation. I hope to see the significance of expression in both tumor and non tumor tissues in all the samples, and in both breast cancer and liver cancer samples separately. In the dataset, rows represent the various genes we're looking at while the columns are the various tissue samples that are classified as either breast or liver cancer related and also tumor or non-tumor. After running a variety of t-tests comparing all tumor and non tumor expression, just liver tumor and non tumor expression, and just breast cancer tumor and non tumor expression, we can adequately say that both RAD51C and TP53 are important genes in breast cancer and liver cancer respectively. They affect expression significantly and the p-values indicated that the null hypothesis was correct correlating that they were significant in affecting the difference in expression in tumor and non tumor samples.
